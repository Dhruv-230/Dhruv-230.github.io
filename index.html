        <h1>Poem</h1>
        <p>
            Beneath the sky so vast and blue,<br/>
            The morning wakes with drops of dew.<br/>
            A gentle breeze through willow trees, <br/>
            Whispers secrets to the seas. <br/>

            Mountains tall and rivers wide,<br/>
            Hold the stories time can't hide. <br/>
            The sun dips low, <em>a golden fire,</em> <br/>
            Painting dreams that never tire. <br/>

            Night falls softly, stars ignite, <br/>
            A quiet <strong>promise in the night.</strong>
        </p>
